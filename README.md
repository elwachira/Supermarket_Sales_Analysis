# Supermarket_Sales_Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a supermarket sales dataset, focusing on customer behavior, sales trends, and performance across branches and product lines.
### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains sales records from a supermarket, including the following columns:

Invoice ID: Unique transaction identifier
- Branch: Store branch (A, B, or C)
- City: Location of the branch
- Customer type: Member or Normal
- Gender: Customer gender
- Product line: Category of the item sold
- Unit price: Price per unit of product
- Quantity: Number of units purchased
- Tax 5%: Tax applied to the purchase
- Total: Total amount (including tax)
- Date: Date of purchase

### Objectives
- Identify sales trends by date and product line.
- Compare performance across branches.
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior by gender and type.
- Evaluate product line profitability and popularity.
- Discover insights from payment methods and gross income.
- Visualize key metrics using plots.

### Tools
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

### Sample Insights
- Most profitable branch and best-selling product line
- Peak sales days
- Preferred payment method by customer type
- Correlation between rating and gross income

### Sample codes

  #### To determine best selling product lines.
  
       df['Product line'].value_counts()

  ### Plotting a bar plot showing;

  #### Total sales by Gender.

     sns.barplot(x='Gender', y='Total', data=df)

  #### Total sales by customer type

     sns.barplot(x='Customer type', y='Total', data=df)
  ### Time Series trend
  #### Line graph 

     daily_sales = df.groupby('Date')['Total'].sum()
     daily_sales.plot(title="Daily Sales Trend")

   ##### Insights gathered from the correlation.

     Tax 5%, Total, cogs, and gross income are all perfectly positively correlated (1.00),this makes sense since they're mathematically linked.

     Unit price shows a moderate positive correlation (~0.60) with revenue and income,higher priced items = more profit.

     Quantity is not strongly correlated with total sales or income,Could mean higher quantity doesnâ€™t always mean higher revenue (depends on price).

     Rating has almost no correlation with any financial metrics

  #### Gross Income VS Rating
